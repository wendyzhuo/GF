Designed new paradigms. Filtered problematic/illegal things (PLURNOUN, ILLEGALVERB, POSTPONE, TODO).
Just 9035 lemmas missing now.

28/3
Set up an experiment with 3220 complete trees from Penn prepared by Krasimir. First results:
  561 no linearization
  960 lin with unknowns

around 20 missing syntax constructions, 230 missing words 

29/3
Added most missing syntax constructions.
Some new opers in ParadigmsFin, and 230 more words in DictEngFin: out of 3220 Penn trees now 2721 
are completely translated (but mostly not so well...)
  317 no lin
  182 lin with unknowns
