<h2>About</h2>
<p>
Grammatical Framework (GF), <a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/">grammaticalframework.org</a>, is a multilingual grammar formalism
based on the idea of a shared abstract syntax and mappings between the abstract syntax and
concrete languages. GF has hundreds of users all over the world.
</p>
<p>
The GF Resource Grammar Library (RGL) implements the morphology (inflection) and basic syntax
(phrase structure) of some 26 languages:

Bulgarian,
Catalan,
Chinese,
Danish,
Dutch,
English,
Finnish,
French,
German,
Hindi,
Interlingua,
Japanese,
Italian,
Latvian,
Nepali,
Norwegian bokmål,
Persian,
Polish,
Punjabi,
Romanian,
Russian,
Sindhi,
Spanish,
Swedish,
Thai, and
Urdu.

These resources are freely available as open-source software. More languages are under construction,
in both in-house and external projects (Greek and Maltese forthcoming by the summer school).
</p>
<p>
We are constantly welcoming new languages, especially from new language families, as well as
EU languages not yet covered by the Resource Grammar Library
(Estonian, Lithuanian, Irish, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Slovene, and Portuguese).
Learn more at the <a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/lib/doc/status.html">RGL status page</a>. The Summer School is an excellent place to get started with a new language.
</p>
<p>
This year's special theme of “Scaling up Grammar Resources” means
extending the existing resource grammars with the ultimate goal of
dealing with any text in the supported languages. Lexicon extension is
an obvious part of this work, but also new grammatical constructions
are of interest.  Porting resources from other open-source approaches,
such as WordNets and Apertium, is one method of doing this. And
reciprocally, we want to make GF resources easily reusable in other
approaches.
</p>
<!-- p>
The Summer School also has tracks for those interesting in applications (e.g. web and 
mobile applications, and embedded grammars in C, C++, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Python), as
well as a theory track (parsing, grammar compilation, statistical GF models).
</p -->

<h2>Venue</h2>
<img src="http://www.mpq.mpg.de/Theorygroup/CIRAC/wiki/images/f/f9/Kloster.jpg" alt="Frauenchiemsee island" />
<p>
The summer school will take place at the <a href="http://www.frauenwoerth.de/english/">Frauenwörth Monastery</a>,
on Frauenchiemsee island in Chiemsee lake, Bavaria, Germany (<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/uUnxN">map</a>).
</p>

<h2>Preliminary schedule</h2>

<h3>First week (18-23 August):<br/>Introduction to GF and multilingual grammar programming</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tutorial on using the GF resource grammar library for small applications</li>
  <li>Tutorial on the GF programming language</li>
  <li>Tutorial on how to write a miniature resource grammar (morphology, paradigms, syntax)</li>
  <li>Tutorial on complexity aspects, grammar compilation, portable grammar format</li>
  <li>Tutorial on using new GF-tools like Eclipse IDE and GF Cloud</li>
</ul>

<p>
Tutorials will be given in morning sessions; supervised exercises in the
afternoon will make the attendants familiar with programming in GF.
</p>

<h3>Second week (25-30 August):<br/>Advanced work in specialized tracks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Resource Grammar track: large-scale grammar implementation for a new language</li>
  <li>Application track: web applications, ontologies</li>
  <li>Theory track: type theory, parsing, compiler issues</li>
  <li>Hybrid systems: connection with statistical methods</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the mornings, each day is dedicated to a special track, with plenary
talks attended by all participants.
For the afternoons we want to organize group work on the various tracks,
and have the participants choose which group they join. On the last day,
results of these groups will be presented to all participants.
